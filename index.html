        <p>Oh, hey. Welcome to the wonderful universe that is my website. I'll be real with y'all, this website was literally only created for a class, but hey, I like to develop websites anyway, so I'm actually having fun here.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>"But Theo, why should I care about what you have to say?" You say to me.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Because I'm cool, okay? At least let me believe that I'm cool so I have some shred of self-esteem.</p>
        <p>Anyway, feel free to check back on this site regularly to see if I ever update it at all. Maybe I will, maybe I won't, all I know is that I'm enjoying myself creating this thing. Hip hip hooray.</p>
