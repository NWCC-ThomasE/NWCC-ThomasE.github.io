      <h3>Every website's gotta have one.</h3>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hi, welcome to the monochrome and barren wasteland that is this website. I created this thing for my Information and Software technology class just so I have something to show at the end of the term.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>So far we have three pages:</p>
      <ul style="list-style: circle">
        <li>The <a href="index.html">Home</a> page, which is this one.</li>
        <li>A <a href="work.html">Work</a> page, where I'll put all of my schoolwork so readers can see my countless failures.</li>
        <li>And an <a href="about.html">About</a> page, where y'all can learn some neat facts about me.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>To conclude this weak home page, I hope y'all enjoy reading and get some sort of information or opinion of me out of it.</p>
      <p>Oh yeah and also credit to Declan Davis for providing the code for that dope navigation bar.</p>
