        <p>Hey there. On the internet, I go by the name "Theo Centari" (not my real name). I'm an aspiring artist and developer in high school that is literally trying his best, please give him some slack.</p>
        <p>I've got a passion for coding, programming, the whole deal. I've been fascinated in developing and creating websites and games from back in primary school, and that interest has only grown and developed as the years have gone on. I've had my share of experiences with it all, having created a few small games and dozens of websites that have never seen the light of day.</p>
        <p>I've got a <a style="color: red; font-weight: bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKjT6-Nl0ck03hDNcYEi_g">YouTube Channel</a> that I upload stuff to occasionally. Usually just small ideas that I want to make into videos because I want the world to see them. It's not a lot of stuff but atleast I have fun making them.</p>
